    "# Miniproject 1: Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important dates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Project release: Friday, 15th March 2019\n",
    "- **Submission deadline**: Monday, 29th April 2019, 11:59 pm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the deepest traditions in learning about deep learning is to first [tackle the exciting problem of MNIST classification](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). [The MNIST database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used as a first test for new classification algorithms. \n",
    "We follow this tradition to investigate the performance of artificial neural networks of different complexity on MNIST. However, since MNIST is too easy for accessing the full power of modern machine learning algorithms (see e.g. [this post](https://twitter.com/goodfellow_ian/status/852591106655043584)) we will extend our analysis to the recently introduced, harder [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should have a running installation of [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and [keras](https://keras.io/). Feel free to gain inspiration from the [Keras example directory](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples) for your implementations.\n",
    "- You should know the concepts \"multilayer perceptron\", \"stochastic gradient descent with minibatches\", \"convolutional neural network\", \"training and validation data\", \"overfitting\" and \"early stopping\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will learn how to define feedforward neural networks in keras and fit them to data.\n",
    "- You will be guided through a prototyping procedure for the application of deep learning to a specific domain.\n",
    "- You will get in contact with concepts discussed later in the lecture, like \"regularization\", \"batch normalization\" and \"convolutional networks\".\n",
    "- You will gain some experience on the influence of network architecture, optimizer and regularization choices on the goodness of fit.\n",
    "- You will learn to be more patient :) Some fits may take your computer quite a bit of time; run them over night (or on an external server).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation is (mostly) based on the figures you submit and your answer sentences. Provide clear and concise answers respecting the indicated maximum length (answers to the questions should be below the line that says \"Answer to question ...\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**The submitted notebook must be run by you!** We will only do random tests of your code and not re-run the full notebook. There will be fraud detection sessions at the end of the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your names\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before you start**: please enter your full name(s) in the field below."

    "Adding hidden layers to a deep network does not necessarily lead to a straight-forward improvement of performance. Overfitting can be counteracted with regularization and dropout. Batch normalization is supposed to mainly speed up convergence. Since the MNIST dataset is almost perfectly solved already by a one-hidden-layer network we use the Fashion-MNIST dataset in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add one or two hidden layers with 50 hidden neurons (each) and train the network for a sufficiently long time (at least 100 epochs). Since deep models are very expressive you will most probably encounter overfitting. Try to improve the best validation scores of the model (even if it is only a minor improvement) by experimenting with batch_normalization layers, dropout layers and l1- and l2-regularization on weights (kernels) and biases. (4 pts)\n",
    "2. After you have found good settings, plot the learning curves for both models, naive (=no tricks/regularization) and tuned (=tricks + regularized), preferably together in a comparison plot. Discuss your results; refer to the model performance with only 1 hidden layer. (2 sentences max.) (2pts)\n",
    "3. Fit your best performing (probably regularized deep) model also to MNIST for having a reference for the next exercise. Plot the resulting learning curves. (2 pts)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original publication of batch normalization [Ioffe and Szegedy, 2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf), the authors mention a particularly beneficial effect of their method on networks with sigmoidal activation functions. This is because such networks usually suffer from saturating activations/vanishing gradients. Here we want to reproduce this behaviour (Chose either MNIST or Fashion-MNIST for this exercise).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement the same convolutional network as in the previous exercise, but using the sigmoid activation function instead of the standard choice ReLU. Train the network for a reasonable amount of time. What do you observe? (1 sentence max.) (3 pts)\n",
    "2. Add batch-normalization layers to all convolutional and fully-connected layers (i.e. before each layer with learnable parameters). How does the performance change? Can the network reach the ReLU-CNN performance of the previous exercise? (1 sentence max.) (3 pts)\n",
    "3. **BONUS (optional, not graded**): Investigate our initial guess that saturating activity/vanishing gradients might be the cause of this behaviour. For that, create histograms of the hidden activitions for different hidden layers for the sigmoid-CNN and the sigmoid-CNN with batch-normalization (counting over both, samples and neurons per layer). You may only chose layers with learnable parameters. What do you observe?\n",
    "Hint: You can use the [keract](https://github.com/philipperemy/keract) package to access neural activation values for all layers of your network model.\n",
